## OvenInjector

OvenInjector is a modloader and modding SDK for [Pizza Tower](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/) that takes a different approach compared to patch modding (`xdelta` modding). Instead of directly replacing the `data.win`, it instead is built-in in the game itself, and let's modders plug in their own stuff. This is still a WIP, however, so a lot of stuff may change!

## Get Started

Start downloading the mod at [the gamebanana page](https://gamebanana.com/wips/84115) and read the documentation and included sample mods to get started!
